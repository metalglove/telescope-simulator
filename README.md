# Telescope Simulator
This repository aims to create a telescope simulator in Rust and WebGL2.

## Ideas
- Based on log files from software like NINA and ASIAIR, animate the imaging session
  - Simulate POV in the sky
- Create gallery of own images
  - Select a target and "zoom-in" on that target showing the final image
  - Show metadata for that image (based on log files from imaging session)
